\begin{minipage}{.65\linewidth}
  The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(Star_Trek)}{replicator} aboard USS Enterprise has developed a fault---synthesized apples have insufficient nutrition but are otherwise identical to regular apples. Doctor \href{https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Beverly_Crusher}{Beverly Crusher} is on the case. Scanning a bunch of apples, her \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tricorder}{tricorder} can indicate if the bunch contains any faulty apples, but it cannot identify them.
\end{minipage}

    Dr. Crusher is investigating a bunch of 12 apples out of which, 1 is known to be faulty. 
    Describe how she can identify the faulty apple in no more than 4 tricorder scans. Furthermore, what is the minimum number of scans that Dr. Crusher needs to perform in order to guarantee finding the single faulty apple in a bunch of size $n$? Justify your answer.
